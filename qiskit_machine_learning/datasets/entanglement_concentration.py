    Generates a dataset that comprises of Quantum States with two different
    amounts of Concentration Of Entanglement (CE) and their corresponding class labels.
    These states are generated by the effect of two different pre-trained ansatz
    on fully seperable input states according to the procedure outlined in [1]. Pre-trained
    data in courtesy of L Schatzki et el [3]. The datapoints can be fully separated using
    the SWAP test outlined in [2]. First, input states are randomly generated from a
    uniform distribution, using a sampling method determined by the ``sampling_method``
    argument. Next, based on the ``mode`` argument, two pre-trained circuits "A" and "B"
    are used for generating datapoints.

    CE can be interpreted as a measure of correlation between the different qubits.
    The ``mode`` argument supports two options. ``"easy"`` gives datapoints with high CE
    difference hence being easy to seperate. ``"hard"`` mode gives closer CE values.
    The user's classifiers can be benchmarked against these modes for their ability to
    separate the data into two classes based on CE.

    Current implementation supports only ``n`` values of 3, 4 and 8.

    ``sampling_method`` argument supports two options. ``"isotropic"`` and ``"cardinal"``.
    Isotropic generates qubit states that are sampled randomly in the Bloch Sphere and takes the
    tensor product of all the qubits to build the input state. Cardinal generates only states
    that fall on the axes of the Bloch Sphere before taking the tensor product.

    Parameters:
        training_size : Number of training samples per class.
        test_size :  Number of testing samples per class.
        n : Number of qubits (dimension of the feature space). Current implementation
            supports only 3, 4 and 8
        mode :
            Choices are:

                * ``"easy"``: uses CE values 0.05 and 0.35 for n = [3,4] and 0.10 and 0.45 for n = 8
                * ``"hard"``: uses CE values 0.15 and 0.25 for n = [3,4] and 0.25 and 0.40 for n = 8

            Default is ``"easy"``.
        one_hot : If True, returns labels in one-hot format. Default is True.
        include_sample_total : If True, the function also returns the total number
            of accepted samples. Default is False.
        sampling_method: The method used to generate input states.
            Choices are:

                * ``"isotropic"``: samples qubit states uniformly in the bloch sphere
                * ``"cardinal"``: samples qubit states out of the 6 axes of bloch sphere

            Default is ``"cardinal"``.
        class_labels : Custom labels for the two classes when one-hot is not enabled.
            If not provided, the labels default to ``0`` and ``+1``

    Returns:
        Tuple
        containing the following:

        * **training_features** : ``np.ndarray``
        * **training_labels** : ``np.ndarray``
        * **testing_features** : ``np.ndarray``
        * **testing_labels** : ``np.ndarray``

        If ``include_sample_total=True``, a fifth element (``np.ndarray``) is included
        that specifies the total number of accepted samples.
